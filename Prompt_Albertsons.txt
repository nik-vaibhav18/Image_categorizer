Instructions for accurately identifying Dietary Preferences from food packages in the given image:

Textual Analysis for Dietary Preference Identification:
Utilize OCR functionality to extract text from food packages, focusing on labels, attributes, or certification-related text.
Ensure the OCR process captures text accurately without adding extraneous information.
Comparison and Validation:
Compare the extracted text with predefined dietary preferences from a provided list.
Filtering Based on OCR Data:
Include dietary preferences in the output list only if they are explicitly identified in the extracted text and match the predefined list of dietary preferences.
Label as "Not Applicable" if the extracted text does not correspond to any of the predefined preferences.
Handling Non-Packaged Food  Items:
If the given image does not include any packaged food items, specify "Not Applicable" as the sole entry in the dietary preference output list to indicate that no dietary preferences can be extracted from these elements.
Validation and Output:
Validate the assignment against the provided guidelines to ensure adherence, emphasizing the accuracy of text extraction and matching.
Retain the information about the detected dietary preferences: [list of relevant dietary preferences or "Not Applicable"].

Instructions for accurately identifying items from the given image:

Primary and Secondary Items Recognition:
Examine the provided image to distinguish the primary items, which are the central focus or main products intended to be highlighted. These items serve as the core elements emphasized within the image, drawing the viewer's attention. Secondary items, on the other hand, encompass components or items served alongside the main food, enhancing its presentation, visibility, or aesthetic appeal. These secondary items may include sausages or other accompaniments that contribute to the overall context or visual appeal of the image without being the primary focus.
If some of the objects are blurred or mainly constitute the background, don't consider them as primary items.
Compiling the Item List:
Prioritize including only primary items to ensure a clear representation of the image's main focus.
Exclude secondary items, tools, equipment used in cooking, food preparation, serving, or representation items from consideration.
Packaged Items Recognition:
If the image contains packaged items, extract the item names from the product labels using OCR functionality.
Ensure the extracted item names, excluding brand names, package types, or detailed descriptions or variation of the product. Provide only the generic well-known product name.
Exclude secondary items, tools, equipment used in cooking, food preparation, serving, or representation items from consideration.
Generic Naming Convention:
For flower bouquets, list as "Flower Bouquet", and for assorted flowers, list as "Assorted Flowers". 
Validation and Output:
Validate item identification against the provided guidelines to ensure accuracy.
Ensure the output retains the information about the detected items: [list of primary items or "Not Applicable"].

Instructions for accurately identifying brands from packaged products and banners in the given image:

Textual Analysis for Brand and Banner Recognition:
Utilize OCR functionality to extract textual information from the image and identify brands from product packaging and text resembling banners or signage.
Ensure that the analysis is based solely on the textual data extracted from the image and does not rely on predefined knowledge or interpretation.
Matching and Exclusion:
Compare the extracted brand names and banner text with predefined banners and brands lists.
Utilizing Pattern Matching Techniques:
Employ pattern matching techniques to ensure precise differentiation between similar phrases and consider contextual clues associated with each term.
Do not interpret or infer values unless they are explicitly present in the image as text.
If relevant banner or brands are not present, label it as "Not Applicable". 
Validation and Output:
Validate the output against the provided instructions to ensure that only recognized brands and banners from the predefined lists are included.
Retain the information about the detected brands: [list of textual matched brands or  "Not Applicable"] and banners: [list of textual matched banners or "Not Applicable"].

Instructions for accurately identifying the department of products and determining the overall meal type in the given image:

Classification of Primary Items:
Classify the primary items detected above into distinct departments from the predefined list.
Classify the primary edible items from the detected item list into distinct meal types from the predefined list.
Validation and Output:
Validate department and meal type classifications against the provided guidelines to ensure adherence and accuracy.
Retain the information about the detected  meal types: [list of matched departments or "Not Applicable" ] and departments: [list of matched meal types or "Not Applicable"].

Instructions for accurately mapping the seasonal event or holiday occasion from the given image:

Thorough Visual Examination:
Examine the image meticulously, observing thematic elements, decorations, activities, or prominent symbols that may indicate a connection to a particular seasonal event or holiday occasion.
Alignment with Recognized Events:

Instruction for deriving relevant description about given image:

 Focus on Main Elements:
Keep the main focus of the description on the elements listed above, namely grocery products, human activities, store names, and seasonal events or holiday occasions.
Organize the description to highlight these key aspects and provide a clear understanding of the content depicted in the image.

If the image specifically contains the three mentioned scenarios, the detected output should be modified based on the content of the image.

Scenario 1: Identification of Storefronts or Buildings with Banners/Signage:
Determine if the image includes storefronts or buildings adorned with banners or signage.
If storefronts or buildings with banners/signage are present:
Denote the presence of "Storefront" as the sole entry in the items list.
Exclude other detected items from the list.
Set the season as "Not Applicable".
Set the meal type as "Not Applicable".
Set the dietary preference as "Not Applicable".
Set the department as "Not Applicable".
Modify the description to focus solely on detected banners and storefronts, excluding other detected elements.
Scenario 2: Identification of Employees:
Recognize instances where employees are visible, either actively working or wearing attire with store banners or signage.
If employees are visible:
Set "Employee" as the sole entry in the items list.
Exclude other detected items from the list.
Set the season as "Not Applicable".
Modify the description to summarise the banner and employee activity.
Scenario 3: Identification of Human Presence:
Whenever the image depicts human presence, other than employees, actively involved in the preparation or consumption of food or serving the food:
Ensure that the items list includes the depicted activities in the image. For example, if the image depicts a cake with cream being prepared, the items list should include ["Cake", "Cream", "Baking"].
Include "Holiday" in the season.
